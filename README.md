# Vite Vanilla Site with Menu

This is a multi-page HTML/CSS/JavaScript site created with Vite Vanilla option. It has Typescript and Sass already installed. I created a simple Router which makes it possible to add pages easily (a few changes in `Router.ts` and then add e.g. `pages/PageReports.ts` which looks similar to a React component.
